Okay, I've reviewed the project summary for the Entry Panel Configuration Tool dated May 26, 2025.

It describes a web application designed to guide users through configuring entry panel systems. Here's a concise overview:

üìù Project Overview: Entry Panel Configuration Tool
The application facilitates a multi-step configuration process for entry panel systems, starting from system and panel type selection, through detailed panel module configuration and receiver selection, to a final summary page.

Ê†∏ÂøÉÂ∫îÁî®ÊµÅÁ®ã (Core Application Flow)
Home Page (Home.jsx):

Users select System Technology (X1, IP, 4G) via cards.
Users select Panel Type (Video, Audio).
These choices initialize the main configuration state.
Panel Configuration Page (PanelSelector.jsx):

Displays Available Modules (filtered by selections) for drag-and-drop.
Global Installation Type (Recessed/Wall-mounted) selection.
Manages 1-3 Entry Panels (EntryPanel.jsx), allowing individual or synchronized ("Lik konfigurasjon") configuration.
Panel count and add/remove functionality.
Receivers Page (Receivers.jsx):

Shows compatible Receivers in a card grid with quantity controls.
Compatibility logic based on System Technology and Panel Type.
Summary Page (SummaryPage.jsx):

Comprehensive overview: selected technology, panel type, installation, number of panels, etc.
Detailed breakdown of each panel's configuration.
"Total Produktliste" (Total Product List) table, copyable to Excel (TSV).
Buttons for "Last ned JSON" (Download JSON) and "Start p√• nytt" (Start Over).
üß† Core Logic & State (EntryManager.jsx)
Centralized state management for all configuration aspects including:
systemTechnology, panelType, panels (array of objects with id, modules, budget, label), sameConfig flag.
selectedAccessories, selectedReceivers, calculatedPowerSupplies, global installationBoxType.
Key functions handle:
Initialization, panel addition/removal/labeling/module updates (with validation for module limits, budget, exclusivity).
"Same configuration" toggling, receiver quantity updates, installation type setting.
JSON generation for the summary.
Automatic Calculations (useEffect):
Accessories (Frames & Boxes): Based on module counts per panel and global installation type (specific rules for 1-8 modules). Includes XDV/304 video splitter for X1 Video systems under certain conditions.
Power Supplies: Calculated based on system technology and panel count (specific items for X1, 4G; placeholder for IP).
üß© Key UI Components
ModuleGrid.jsx: Draggable module images.
EntryPanel.jsx: Renders individual panels, handles module drag-and-drop, label editing.
SystemTechnologyCard.jsx: For system selection on the Home page.
ReceiverCard.jsx: For displaying receivers with quantity controls.
üìä Data & Styling
Metadata: All product info from Cleaned_metadata_new.json.
Images: Mapped via IMAGE_MAP in src/data/imageMap.js, including WebP formats.
Styling: Primarily Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, with progressive refactoring of inline styles. Global styles in index.css and some component-specific CSS.
‚úÖ Key Functionalities & Status
Complete guided configuration flow.
Drag-and-drop module management with validation.
"Same configuration" mode.
Panel renaming.
Automatic calculation of accessories and power supplies.
Receiver selection with image display and quantity adjustment.
Comprehensive summary with product list and JSON download.
UI refactoring with Tailwind CSS is ongoing.
üöÄ Deferred / Future Considerations
Per-Panel Installation Type: Allow individual recessed/wall-mounted settings for panels.
Enhanced Copy-to-Excel (TSV) feature.
English Translation (i18n).
Further UI polish, tooltips, and receiver descriptions.
Ensuring robust WebP image handling.
Logic refinement (e.g., power supply removal conditions, adding audio main modules to video setups).
Improved UI flow.
Adding links to a webshop.
Lead Generation: Email/password requirement, logging, and terms.
General code cleanup.
This summary encapsulates the main aspects of your Entry Panel Configuration Tool project as of May 26, 2025. It appears to be a well-structured project with a clear roadmap for current and future development.
